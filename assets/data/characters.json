He found comfort in his mother, a kind yet formidable warrior—formerly a Stormwing Elite Guardian.<br><br> During the Great War of Eldoria, their homeland was attacked by the Nethersteel Pact—a rogue Umbrakith faction bent on conquest. Ren and his younger sister Rayza were nearly lost, but their mother gave her life to protect them. The clan barely survived.<br><br> After the war, everything changed. Ren’s father became cold and harsh, pushing him into relentless training. Though bruised and scarred, Ren never resisted. He endured—for his father, for Rayza, and to protect what remained of their family. Rayza, still young and afraid, would secretly tend to his wounds in the quiet of night.<br><br> Determined to prove himself, Ren grew stronger through discipline and hardship. He led expeditions, helped rebuild their clan, and eventually earned his father’s respect. For his final trial, he ascended the thousand-step path to the highest peak of the Hidden Mist Valley. There, within an ancient temple, he challenged one of the Three Elder Dragons.<br><br> After hours of battle, Ren unlocked his dormant bloodline—becoming Dragonkin. The dragon bowed to him in recognition, and he returned home transformed.<br><br> Years later, a letter arrived from the Magellion Empire—a call for peace and diplomacy. Ren’s father accepted. Ren volunteered to represent his people. Before leaving, he embraced Rayza and whispered: “Don’t worry, I’ll be back.” Then he set out, a warrior of flame and honor, to shape the future with the fire of the past."

      "background": "Rayza Bakonawa was born into a prestigious family known for their skill in swordsmanship and battle strategy. From an early age, she idolized her father and her older brother, Ren—both praised for their strength and discipline. Rayza longed to join them and prove her worth as a warrior.<br><br> However, bound by tradition and protectiveness, her father refused to train her. He believed the warrior’s path was not meant for her. But instead of breaking her spirit, his rejection only fueled it. Determined to prove that strength wasn’t limited by tradition or gender, Rayza began training in secret.<br><br> Ren, recognizing her passion and remembering a promise their mother once made for her, became her silent supporter. He offered her guidance in secret, helping her grow without drawing their father’s attention.<br><br> When word of a prestigious swordsmanship tournament spread through the Hidden Mist Valley, Rayza saw her chance. Disguised to hide her identity, she entered the tournament. With each match, she defeated her opponents one by one—until she reached the final round.<br><br> There, to her shock, stood her final opponent: her brother, Ren.<br><br> She hesitated, fearing her secret would be revealed. But Ren’s smirk and knowing glance told her he had recognized her all along. He remained silent, respecting her resolve. Rayza steeled herself and fought fiercely. The duel was intense, with both siblings pushing each other to their limits.<br><br> Near defeat, something deep within her awakened—a dormant power passed down through their bloodline. A red aura enveloped her, and she entered a heightened state known as 'Blood Rage.' Her strength and speed surged beyond normal limits. The crowd watched in awe as the siblings clashed with near-mythical intensity.<br><br> In the stands, their father watched in silence. Shock turned to realization as he recognized the aura—the same one their mother once unleashed in battle. Torn between fear and pride, he made no move to stop them.<br><br> After nearly an hour of fierce combat, Rayza collapsed from exhaustion. Though she lost the match, she had proven herself.<br><br> She awoke at home, with Ren and her father at her side. Before she could speak, her father placed a hand on her shoulder, his voice heavy with emotion:<br><br> 'I was only trying to protect you. You remind me so much of your mother before I watched her fall. But I see now—I was wrong. I won’t always be here to shield you. Maybe you don’t need me to. Keep growing, Rayza. Become strong… and wise. And Ren,' he said, turning to his son, 'look after your sister.'<br><br> In that moment, Rayza received the acceptance she had long yearned for. Their family shared a quiet embrace—a promise unspoken, but deeply understood. From that day on, Rayza's path became clear—not just to prove her worth, but to carry forward the strength, legacy, and love that shaped her."

      "background": "Liliana Solarae, the Radiant Empress, is the revered founder and current ruler of the Magellion Empire—an empire born from ruin and risen from the ashes of a shattered world.<br><br> After the death of the Solaraenian God and the tragic sealing of her mother, Lunara, during the Great War, young Liliana was thrust into chaos. The celestial homeland of Solaraenia was obliterated. The proud Umbrakith were nearly wiped from existence. And Eldoria, once vibrant and united, teetered on the brink of collapse.<br><br> At the center of this devastation, Liliana witnessed the unthinkable: her beloved aunt, Blessica, sacrificing herself to seal the corrupted Lunara and prevent further destruction. As the sealing spell drained her strength, Blessica placed her hands on Liliana’s shoulders and gave her a sacred vow.<br><br> 'Restore what we’ve lost. Protect the future. Lead them home.'<br><br> Liliana nodded through tears. As Blessica ascended in radiant light, mortals and celestials alike knelt before the child of divine and umbrakith blood—her aura glowing with purpose.<br><br> With a steady breath and unwavering heart, Liliana summoned a great beam of light from the heavens. It poured over her like a divine blessing. As Eldoria crumbled around her, she lifted her hands—and in them, a crystal formed, pulsing with pure, radiant energy.<br><br> This 'Beacon Surge' resonated with the very soul of Eldoria. In a single, luminous wave, the light rippled outward. Darkness recoiled. Corruption melted into air. Hope was reborn.<br><br> From that moment, Liliana was no longer a child of tragedy—She became the dawn reborn—the light after ruin.<br><br> As the years passed, she matured under the weight of destiny. While others clung to division, she envisioned unity. Where despair lingered, she brought hope. Determined to break the cycle of endless war, she summoned the remaining leaders of Eldoria and proposed a Grand Council—a final plea for peace.<br><br> Not all agreed, but many were moved by the clarity and grace in her voice. Her words awakened something ancient and true in their hearts.<br><br> To safeguard this fragile peace, Liliana founded the Light Harbingers—an elite order drawn from every race and realm. Membership was not given lightly. She forged the Trials herself: not tests of strength, but of compassion, resolve, and unwavering heart.<br><br> Through her leadership, Eldoria slowly began to heal. The once-divided nations began to sing her name. She became a living beacon—not only of survival, but of unity, light, and love.<br><br> And yet... behind her serene gaze lies vigilance. In her quiet dreams, Liliana sees it—A veiled figure beneath a dying sky… a second darkness… and silence that devours light itself."

      "background": "Lunara was once a celestial being—pure, radiant, and beloved. She was the selfless and compassionate princess of Solaraenia, destined to inherit the throne and bring eternal light to her people. She embodied everything a ruler should be—kind yet strong, wise yet humble. But love, the most beautiful and dangerous force, would become her ruin.<br><br> In secret, she fell for Zion, the prince of the Umbrakiths—the sworn enemies of the Solaraenians for eons. Their love was a forbidden flame, burning against the tides of history and war. They met not as enemies, but as two wandering souls lost in the vastness of the realms. In Zion, Lunara saw not a monster or rival, but a heart that beat in harmony with hers. And to him, she was not just a celestial heir—but a light he had never known in his darked world.<br><br> But love is not enough to break the chains of destiny. When their secret was unveiled, the Solarae God's fury shook the heavens. He accused Lunara of treason—of being corrupted by Umbrakith magic. Her people turned against her, branding her a traitor to their divine bloodline.<br><br> In the eyes of the Solaraenians, she was no longer their princess. She was tainted, lost, a disgrace. And so, she was cast down—banished from Solaraenia and exiled into the mortal land of Eldoria.<br><br> But her fall was only the beginning. The Umbrakiths, stunned by the revelation, had not plotted to claim the celestial princess—but now they were forced into war. The Solaraenians, blinded by rage, saw no redemption—only war.<br><br> And so, the Great War of Eldoria began. A conflict forged not by hatred, but by a love the world refused to accept. Amidst the bloodshed, Lunara and Zion fought together—not as rulers of warring nations, but as lovers desperate to stop the slaughter. They pleaded, they struggled, they tried to hold back the tides of fate itself.<br><br> But fate is cruel. On the battlefield, Zion fell. The blade meant for Lunara pierced through the heart of the man she loved.<br><br> His blood clung to her trembling hands like a vow undone. Warm. Real. Fading. Her scream never came—it was swallowed by the silence of a shattered world. The battlefield blurred. Time itself shattered. She saw every moment they had shared—his laughter, the whispered promises, the stolen touches beneath forbidden skies. His voice, calling her name, fading into silence. His warmth, now only a lifeless embrace.<br><br> And something inside her broke. A whisper left her lips—a prayer, a curse, an agony too great for words.<br><br> The sky darkened. The winds howled. A blood moon rose.<br><br> Those who dared to look into her eyes saw only death. An aurora, dark and unholy, erupted around her as her tears turned into rivers of blood. And then… the slaughter began. She bent the blood of those around her, twisting it into lifeless husks, consuming their essence in an unrelenting storm of carnage. The battlefield became a graveyard. Solaraenians, Umbrakiths, all races fell before her wrath.<br><br> She was no longer the celestial princess. No longer the exile. She became something else—a phantom, a reaper, a queen of death.<br><br> That day, the Scarlet Phantom was born. The war ended—not in peace, not in victory, but in silence.<br><br> Now, Lunara lies sealed by her own sister in the very heart of Eldoria. Her heart turned to ice, her soul shackled by the blood of those she loved—and those she loathed.<br><br> She no longer fights for light. Nor for darkness. She seeks something beyond the reach of gods and mortals alike. Perhaps redemption. Perhaps revenge. Or perhaps… she simply searches for the one thing she lost—the love that once made her whole.<br><br> For in the end, Lunara never wished to be queen. She only wished to be with him.<br><br> And that… was the one wish the universe would never grant."

One dark tide, their realm was attacked by a joint force led by the **Nagas**—a draconic, warlike cousin race of the sirens and allies of the **Abyssal Order**. Their aim: to overthrow **King Azure**, Shelain’s beloved husband.<br><br> Shelain had urged him to request aid from the **Magellion Empire**, but King Azure believed they could repel the enemy alone. His pride cost them dearly. During the battle, both the king and their only son fell. One by one, the defenders were overwhelmed.<br><br> With her home in flames beneath the sea and her forces dwindling, Shelain activated the **Ancient Solaraenian Portal**—a sacred relic guarded for generations. Through it came **Empress Liliana** and her Light Harbingers. Together, they drove back the invaders. But the cost was already too great.<br><br> The once-vibrant reefs were corrupted. The waters, tainted. Liliana’s magic helped cleanse the land, but the damage could not be fully undone.<br><br> Shelain blamed herself for not acting sooner. For trusting peace. For hesitating.<br><br> Now, with her crown heavy and her heart scarred, she stands beside the Magellion Empire as a proud ally. Determined to rebuild the ocean’s serenity and safeguard her people, she has vowed vengeance against the Nagas and the Abyssal Order.<br><br> **She fights not only as a queen, but as a mother, a guardian, and a tide that will never be silenced again.**"

      "background": "Blessica, the second daughter of the Solaraenian God, was born in the celestial realm of Solaraenia—a land of radiant light and divine order, home to the ethereal Solaraenian beings. Gifted with potent light magic, she rose as an elite guardian and warrior, known not only for her grace and power, but for her unwavering devotion to her elder sister, Lunara.<br><br> Over time, Blessica noticed a change in Lunara. Her sister vanished into the night, venturing to forbidden realms—most often to the mortal world of Eldoria. Disguised in mortal form, Lunara quietly aided the weak and sought purpose beyond her divine duties. Though heir to the throne, her heart strayed from the royal path. Blessica watched, silently sensing the storm that brewed.<br><br> Eventually, that storm broke. Whispers echoed through the palace: Lunara had fallen for Zion, a prince of the Umbrakith—their sworn enemies. Their love was deemed treason. Desperate, Blessica pleaded for mercy, but the verdict remained. Lunara was to be exiled.<br><br> Heartbroken, Blessica defied the divine decree and followed her sister into Eldoria. There, she found Lunara with Zion—and with them, a child. Their daughter. Lunara placed the girl in Blessica’s arms and whispered:<br><br> “Take her. Keep her safe. I trust you. She is the future of our people.<br><br> Lunara revealed truths their father had hidden—ancient secrets buried so deep that even royal blood dared not speak of them. Though torn with sorrow, Blessica agreed. She took the child, Liliana, and vanished—just as the war ignited between gods and mortals.<br><br> When she returned to Solaraenia, the Order of Light greeted her with grave news: Lunara had vanished into chaos, and named Blessica her successor. As the war escalated, Blessica sent her people and Liliana into hiding, while she and her most loyal warrior returned to the battlefield to search for her sister.<br><br> What they found was devastation. Under a blood moon, an abyssal force swept across the land, annihilating millions. At its center stood Lunara—consumed by darkness. She slew all who stood before her, even their father.<br><br> Blessica confronted her corrupted sister, but Lunara’s power had grown beyond reckoning. As she began casting a catastrophic spell, Blessica invoked a forbidden seal with help from Solaraenian elders, loyal warriors, and her companion. Together, they imprisoned Lunara.<br><br> The sealing came at a terrible cost. Blessica’s form began to glow and fade. As she collapsed, the young Liliana rushed to her side. With her final breath, Blessica whispered:<br><br> “Lead our people… protect her. She is the light of our future… and the hope of this world.<br><br> In a burst of radiant light, Blessica ascended—her soul returning to the heavens. Mortals, celestials, and warriors knelt before Liliana. In that moment, a child became a leader.<br><br> From the ruins of war, Liliana rose to fulfill her aunt’s vow—founding the Magellion Empire upon the sacred grounds where it all began.<br><br> The war ended in silence… but the cost would echo throughout Eldoria for generations to come."

      "background": "Zenyx was born in the aftermath of the **Great War of Eldoria**, in an age of rebuilding and lingering darkness. She never knew her true parents, growing up as an orphan under the care of the **Magellion Orphanage**. While running errands for the caretakers, she found herself mesmerized by the sights of mages casting spells in the streets, children learning minor magic tricks, and scholars debating arcane secrets. From that moment, a spark ignited in her heart—a longing to wield magic of her own.<br><br> Years later, she was adopted by an elderly herbalist who lived alone in a modest cottage on the outskirts of the Magellion Empire’s capital. Those days were simple and filled with quiet joys: tending gardens, collecting rare herbs, and reading by candlelight. The old woman loved Zenyx like family, teaching her about healing plants and the delicate balance of life in nature. But time is cruel. When Zenyx was still young, her adoptive mother passed away, leaving her alone once more.<br><br> Determined to survive and pursue her dream, Zenyx worked odd jobs in the city while secretly teaching herself the basics of magic from discarded scrolls and glimpses of mages at work. Her life changed forever one evening while gathering herbs near her cottage. She was ambushed by a pack of **corrupted beasts**, vicious and warped by dark magic. Despite fighting back with every ounce of courage, she was nearly overrun. Just as she thought her end had come, a towering woman in a black cloak and wide witch hat appeared from the darkness. With a single gesture, the stranger unleashed searing black-violet flames that didn’t explode outward, but instead collapsed inward—devouring the beasts entirely.<br><br> Awed and desperate, Zenyx begged the woman to teach her magic. The mysterious figure hesitated, scrutinizing the determination in Zenyx’s eyes. Then she nodded silently. That woman was none other than **Hexxana**, the Lone Wanderer herself.<br><br> Under Hexxana’s tutelage, Zenyx blossomed. She trained for years in the arts of arcane magic, learning not only spells but survival, discipline, and the secrets of the world. Eventually, Zenyx asked permission to venture out on her own. Hexxana agreed, proud of her pupil’s resolve.<br><br> So Zenyx set out alone to chase the adventures she once only dreamed of. She traversed Eldoria from the vast halls of **Magellion** to the serene groves of **Luminwood**, the veiled mists of **Hidden Mist Valley**, the sunlit shores of the **Azure Coast**, and countless forgotten ruins and perilous dungeons. She fought corrupted creatures, aided villages beset by trouble, crossed paths with strangers both kind and cruel, and forged fleeting friendships with travelers and adventurers. Few dared to explore as relentlessly as she did—even Hexxana herself confessed to never setting foot in some of the places Zenyx visited.<br><br> Eventually, Zenyx felt a new calling—to bring her talents to a higher purpose. She pledged herself to the **Light Harbingers**, determined to stand alongside Liliana and the others to protect Eldoria from the darkness that still linger.<br><br>"
