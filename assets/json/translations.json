    "summaryText": "Hello, I'm Kyu, a self-taught freelance artist who has been passionate about drawing since my early childhood. Over the years, I've been dedicated to honing my skills and self-improvement in the art realm. Drawing has been a constant in my life, and in my free time, I continue to create art to enhance my abilities and gain more experience. Despite being a self-learner, I remain persistent and never give up. After four years of focusing on traditional drawing methods, I began to witness noticeable improvements in my work. Intrigued by the popularity of digital art on various social media platforms, I decided to explore this medium. I ventured into digital art using programs such as Microsoft Paint and Adobe Illustrator for my initial creations. While adapting to the challenges presented by digital art techniques, I eventually became comfortable with the process.",
